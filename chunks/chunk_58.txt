if between 25 and 99 individual Demands are filed, a single 
batch of all those Demands, and, to the extent there are less than 100 Demands remaining 
after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Demands); (2) 
appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch on a 
consolidated basis with one set of filing and administrative fees due per batch, one 
procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be selected by Claimant’s Counsel or, if 
Claimant’s Counsel does not have a preference, by the arbitrator, and one final award, which 
will provide for any and all relief to which the arbitrator determines each individual party is 
entitled ("Batch Arbitration"). NAM shall administer all batches concurrently, to the extent 
possible. 
All parties agree that Demands are of a "substantially similar nature" if they arise out of or 
relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issue(s) and 
seek the same or similar relief.
