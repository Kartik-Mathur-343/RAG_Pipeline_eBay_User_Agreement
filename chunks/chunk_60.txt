This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as 
authorizing a class, collective and/or representative arbitration or action of any kind, except 
as expressly set forth in this provision, and nothing about the Batch Arbitration process will 
preclude any party from participating in any arbitration administered according to that 
process. 
8. Severability 
Except as provided in Section 19.B.3 ("Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief"), if any part or parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than Section 19.B.7 ("Batch 
Arbitration")) are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part 
or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the 
Agreement to Arbitrate shall continue in full force and effect.
